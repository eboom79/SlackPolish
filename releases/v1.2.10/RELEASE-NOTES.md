# SlackPolish v1.2.10 Release Notes

**Release Date:** July 27, 2025  
**Version:** 1.2.10  
**Build:** 10  

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

### Fixed Ctrl+V Hotkey Detection Issue

**Problem:** Users reported that pressing `Ctrl+V` (paste) was incorrectly triggering the SlackPolish text improvement feature, which should only activate with `Ctrl+Shift`.

**Root Cause:** The hotkey detection logic used faulty boolean logic `(!hotkey.alt || !altPressed)` that would always evaluate to `true` when Alt was not required, regardless of whether Alt was actually pressed.

**Solution:** Changed the hotkey matching logic to use exact equality comparisons:
```javascript
// Before (buggy):
const hotkeyMatch =
    (hotkey.ctrl && ctrlPressed) &&
    (hotkey.shift && shiftPressed) &&
    (!hotkey.alt || !altPressed) &&
    (!hotkey.tab || !tabPressed);

// After (fixed):
const hotkeyMatch =
    (hotkey.ctrl === ctrlPressed) &&
    (hotkey.shift === shiftPressed) &&
    (hotkey.alt === altPressed) &&
    (hotkey.tab === tabPressed);
```

## ✅ What's Fixed

- **Ctrl+V no longer triggers text improvement** - Users can paste normally without accidental activation
- **Exact hotkey matching** - Only the configured hotkey combination will trigger the feature
- **Ctrl+Shift+Alt won't trigger Ctrl+Shift** - Extra modifiers prevent activation (exact match required)
- **All configured hotkeys still work** - Ctrl+Shift, Ctrl+Alt, and Ctrl+Tab function correctly

## 🧪 Testing Improvements

### New Test Suite
- **`test_ctrl_v_fix.js`** - Comprehensive tests specifically for this bug fix
