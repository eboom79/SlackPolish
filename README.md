## 📁 Project Structure

SlackPolish uses a **modular architecture** with functionality divided into independent scripts for better maintainability:

### **📜 `slack-text-improver.js`**
Core text improvement functionality with thread awareness. Handles text detection, hotkey processing (Ctrl+Shift), OpenAI API calls, and smart context integration. Uses thread-specific context when in threads for better suggestions.

### **⚙️ `slack-settings.js`**
Independent settings management module. Handles F12 settings menu, user preferences, API key management, developer mode, and version display. Maintains separation of concerns from text improvement.

### **📊 `slack-channel-summary.js`**
Thread-aware summarization module. Handles F10 hotkey with smart context detection, adapts GUI for threads vs channels, extracts thread-specific or channel messages, and provides context-appropriate summarization options.


### **⚙️ `slack-config.js`**
Configuration file containing OpenAI settings, language/style options, detailed prompts, version information, and default preferences. Central configuration for all modules.

### **🎨 `logo-data.js`**
Base64-encoded SlackPolish logo data for clean code organization. Custom logo appears in loading indicators, settings menu, channel summary, and API key popups.

## 🛠️ Installation Instructions

### **🍎 macOS ARM (Apple Silicon)**

**New in this release:** SlackPolish now supports macOS Apple Silicon.

SlackPolish on macOS uses a runtime launcher. It does **not** modify
`Slack.app`, `app-arm64.asar`, or `Info.plist`.

### **Step 1: Install the macOS runtime launcher**
```bash
python3 installers/install-slack-MAC-ARM.py
```

This creates:
- `~/Library/Application Support/SlackPolish Runtime/mac-arm-runtime/current`
- `~/Desktop/SlackPolish.command`
- `~/Desktop/SlackPolish-Attach.command`

### **Step 2: Launch SlackPolish on macOS**
```bash
~/Desktop/SlackPolish.command
```

If Slack is already open:

```bash
~/Desktop/SlackPolish-Attach.command
```

### **Step 3: Verify on macOS**
1. **Wait for Slack to open to your channels**
2. **Open any message input field**
3. **Press Ctrl+Shift** - Should trigger text improvement
4. **Press F12** - Should open settings

### **🐧 Linux Requirements**

**For Linux x64 systems (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc.):**

```bash
# Install Python 3 (if not already installed)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

# Install Node.js and npm
sudo apt install nodejs npm

# Verify installations
python3 --version
npm --version
```

### **Step 1: Download SlackPolish**
```bash
# Navigate to your desired directory
cd /path/to/your/projects/

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/eboom79/SlackPolish.git
cd SlackPolish
```

### **Step 2: Install SlackPolish**
```bash
sudo python3 installers/install-slack-LINUX-X64.py
```


### **Step 3: Verify Installation**
1. **Start Slack Desktop App**
2. **Open any message input field**
3. **Press Ctrl+Shift** - Should show "🤖 Improving text..." indicator
4. **Press F12** - Should open settings menu with version information
5. **Press F10** - Should open Channel Summary window with time range options

### **� First Use - API Key Setup**

**On your first use of SlackPolish**, you'll be prompted to enter your OpenAI API key:

1. **Press Ctrl+Shift** in any message field (or F10 for channel summary)
2. **API Key Popup** will appear automatically if no key is configured
3. **Enter your OpenAI API key** (starts with `sk-...`)
4. **Click "Save & Retry"** - Your key is securely stored locally
5. **Start using SlackPolish** - No further configuration needed!

**💡 Tip**: You can always update your API key later by pressing **F12** → Settings Menu

## 🚫 Platform Support Status

### **✅ Supported Platforms**
- **🐧 Linux x64** - Fully tested and supported (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc.)
- **🍎 macOS ARM** - Newly supported via runtime launcher on Apple Silicon

### **❌ Currently Unsupported Platforms**
- **🪟 Windows** - Not supported at this time

**Note**: the new macOS support uses a runtime launcher and leaves `Slack.app`
untouched. Windows support has not been implemented yet.

### **�🔧 Troubleshooting Installation**

#### **If `asar` tool is missing:**
```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g asar

# Or let the installer handle it automatically
# (it will install locally if global installation fails)
```

#### **If Slack path is not found:**
The installer automatically detects Slack in these locations:
- **Linux:** `/usr/lib/slack/resources`
- **macOS:** `/Applications/Slack.app/Contents/Resources`
- **Windows:** `C:\Program Files\Slack\resources` or `C:\Program Files (x86)\Slack\resources`

#### **macOS-Specific Troubleshooting:**

**Install the macOS runtime launcher with verbose output:**
```bash
python3 installers/install-slack-MAC-ARM.py -v
```

**Launch SlackPolish with verbose runtime logs:**
```bash
python3 installers/launch-slackpolish-MAC-ARM.py --relaunch --launch-mode open -v
```

**Common macOS Issues:**
- **Slack opens without SlackPolish** → Launch Slack from `~/Desktop/SlackPolish.command`
- **Slack is already open** → Use `~/Desktop/SlackPolish-Attach.command`
- **Desktop launcher is missing** → Re-run `python3 installers/install-slack-MAC-ARM.py`
- **Python is missing** → Install Python 3 and retry

#### **If Slack installation is not found (Windows):**
The installer checks these locations automatically:
- `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\slack\resources` (most common)
- `C:\Program Files\Slack\resources`
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Slack\resources`
- `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\slack\resources`
- And 7 other common locations

**If automatic detection fails:**
1. **Find your Slack installation:**
   - Open File Explorer
   - Navigate to where Slack is installed
   - Look for a `resources` folder containing `app.asar` file
2. **The installer will prompt you to enter the path manually**
3. **Common locations to check:**
   ```
   %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\slack\resources
   %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\slack\resources
   C:\Program Files\Slack\resources
   ```

#### **If permission errors occur:**
- **Linux:** Ensure you're using `sudo`
- **Windows:** Run Command Prompt as Administrator

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

### **Complete Removal (All Platforms)**

#### **🐧 Linux Uninstallation**
```bash
# Navigate to Slack resources directory
cd /usr/lib/slack/resources

# Restore original file (requires sudo)
sudo cp app.asar.backup app.asar

# Verify restoration
ls -la app.asar*
```

#### **🍎 macOS Uninstallation**
```bash
python3 installers/uninstall-slack-MAC-ARM.py
```

This removes the SlackPolish runtime files and Desktop launchers. It does not
modify `Slack.app`.

#### **🪟 Windows Uninstallation**
**Run Command Prompt as Administrator**, then:
```cmd
# Navigate to Slack resources directory (adjust path if needed)
cd "C:\Program Files\Slack\resources"

# Restore original file
copy app.asar.backup app.asar

# Verify restoration
dir app.asar*
```
